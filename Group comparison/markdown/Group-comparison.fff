\caption{Modelled serial reaction-time data (group comparison). Reaction-time data are shown for each age group for the final two blocks (block 7 is the transfer block). Shown are the modelled reaction-time data with 95\% HPDI (in msecs) for both adjacency conditions (adjacent, nonadjacent) and the baseline condition.}\label{fig:plotgroupcomp}
